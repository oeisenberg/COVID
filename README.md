# COVID Dashboard
Data obtained using the GOV UK API, whose documentation is [here](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/developers-guide "COVID-19 UK API Documentation"). Using the Python API service available [here](https://github.com/publichealthengland/coronavirus-dashboard-api-python-sdk "COVID-19 UK API Service - Python").

## Introduction
Instead of repeatedly visiting the GOV website during the height of the 3rd UK lockdown I created my own dashboard.

## Overview
Run app.py to host the Flask app on your localhost.
